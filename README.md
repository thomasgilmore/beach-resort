<h1>Beach Resort Website</h1>

<p>This Beach Resort project website uses Contentful to create my own backend that keeps all room information and pictures of hotel rooms to be served to the frontend to be viewed by the user of the website.</p>

<p>I used React to create the frontend for this project, React-Router for the routing of the project, React Context API for state management, Contentful for the data management and Netlify to host the app.</p>
